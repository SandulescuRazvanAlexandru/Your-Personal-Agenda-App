# Mobile Application Documentation

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive mobile application demonstrating various functionalities, including UI/UX components, data handling, asynchronous operations, and external resource access. This README provides a brief overview of each functionality implemented within the app.

## Features

### 1. Activities
The application defines at least six distinct activities, each furnished with appropriate visual controls.

### 2. Visual Controls
The app showcases a range of controls such as:
- Button
- TextView
- EditView
- CheckBox
- Spinner
- ProgressBar
- SeekBar
- Switch
- RatingBar
- ImageView
- DatePicker/TimePicker

### 3. Data Entry Form
There's at least one form dedicated to data input, facilitating user interaction and data submission.

### 4. Parameter Transfer
The app ensures the transfer of both primitive types and custom objects between at least two activities.

### 5. Custom Adapter
A bespoke adapter has been implemented, featuring a minimum of three distinct visual controls.

### 6. Asynchronous Operations
Various asynchronous operations have been introduced for efficient task handling without impeding the UI thread.

### 7. External Resource Access
Classes have been set up to access external network resources, ensuring seamless data fetching.

### 8. JSON File Processing
The app handles JSON files containing:
- At least 3 nodes spread across different levels
- Each node possesses a minimum of 3 attributes.

### 9. Preference Files
The app utilizes preference files, supporting both read and write operations.

### 10. SQLite Database
The app incorporates an SQLite database with:
- At least two tables interlinked.
- Implemented DDL operations.

### 11. DML Operations
For every table, there's a dedicated data access class offering methods for insertion, modification, and deletion. All these methods are invoked within the app.

### 12. Reports
The app provides at least two distinct reports (displayed in activities) that retrieve information from the database. These reports vary in structure.

### 13. 2D Graphics
Bi-dimensional graphic elements are employed, with values fetched directly from the database.

### 14. Image Processing
Images are sourced from various origins including:
- Static images
- Network-derived images
- Gallery images from the mobile device
- Database-sourced images

The app fetches images from at least two of the aforementioned sources.

### 15. App Styling
Aesthetic enhancements have been made to the app, for example:
- A fresh theme created in the `styles.xml` file
- Modifications in font and color schemes of visual components.

### 16. String Resources
All string literals used in the interface are extracted from resources, ensuring easy localization and management.

## Conclusion
This mobile application is a comprehensive showcase of various functionalities essential for a modern-day app. From user interactions to backend data handling, it serves as a reference for developers looking to integrate these features into their projects.
